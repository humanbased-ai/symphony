# Changelog

All notable user-facing changes to the Symphony CLI are recorded here before a
release tag is created.

## Unreleased

- Per-run workspace isolation (IN-286): workspaces are now materialized at
  `<workspace.root>/<workspace_key>/<run_id>` per dispatch. When
  `workspace.repo_url` is configured, Symphony maintains a bare clone at
  `<workspace.root>/.repo.git` and creates a fresh `git worktree` on a unique
  branch for each run; cleanup force-removes the worktree and deletes the
  branch. A startup sweep clears orphan per-run directories from prior crashed
  dispatches. New optional config keys: `workspace.repo_url`,
  `workspace.default_branch` (default `main`), `workspace.branch_prefix`.
- Add `symphony --version` for installed CLI version checks.
- Add `symphony onboard` as the recommended first-run command with environment
  scanning and skip behavior for already-valid setup.
- Add release workflow scaffolding for dry-run, staging, and main artifact
  validation.
